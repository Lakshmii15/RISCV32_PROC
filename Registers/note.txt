Notes :32 registers , 32 bits wide 
	input:
		A1 & A2& A3 5-bit , WD3 32-bit, WE2 - 1 bit
	output:
		RD1 & RD2 32 bit 
	descripption:
		32 registers 32 bits wide, WE write enable ,when write is 
		enabled it writes into WD into address A on ht rising edge of
		the clock if write enable is zero it reads address A into the
		Read bus RD.
